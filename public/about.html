<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Angie Augustin, and I am a passionate software developer currently working on <br />
   building my career in the tech industry. I was born in Haiti and moved to the United States at <br />
   the age of 7, which provided me with a unique perspective and a deep appreciation for hard work, <br />
    resilience, and the opportunities available in the tech world</p>

<p>I began my journey in software development with a focus on front-end development, where I <br />
  discovered my love for creating user-friendly, functional, and visually appealing web applications. <br />
  As I continue to grow in my skills, I’ve expanded my expertise into full-stack development, allowing me to <br />
  build both the client and server-side of applications. This progression has deepened my understanding <br />
  of how to create seamless and efficient solutions from start to finish.</p>

<p>I am driven by my desire to solve problems, build impactful solutions, and continuously learn <br />
   new technologies. My journey as a first-generation college graduate has instilled in me a strong work ethic <br />
    and perseverance, values that I carry with me as I grow in this dynamic field. I’m excited about the <br />
    opportunities that lie ahead and am committed to contributing to the tech industry with both creativity <br />
     and technical expertise.</p>
